# üéØ FINAL LOGO REPLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## **WHAT YOU HAVE:**
- ‚úÖ `icon-1024.png` (your DOGSWAB logo - correct!)
- ‚ùå `AppIcon-512@2x.png` (wrong size, possibly Capacitor logo)

## **WHAT TO DO:**

### **Step 1: Clean Up Icon Files**
1. **Delete**: `AppIcon-512@2x.png` (wrong size)
2. **Rename**: `icon-1024.png` ‚Üí `AppIcon-1024.png`
3. **Keep**: The new `Contents.json` I just provided

### **Step 2: Your Final Icon Folder Should Have:**
```
ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AppIcon-1024.png (your DOGSWAB logo)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Contents.json (points to AppIcon-1024.png)
```

### **Step 3: Upload to GitHub**
1. Upload both files to GitHub
2. Commit message: "Fix app icon to use DOGSWAB logo"
3. Build your app

## **üö® I ALSO REMOVED:**
- All the external logo URLs I was using
- Replaced them with proper local file references
- Cleaned up the manifest.json and other files

## **‚úÖ RESULT:**
Your app will now use YOUR DOGSWAB logo everywhere, not any Capacitor or external logos!

**Sorry for the confusion - I was accidentally pulling in external images instead of using your actual logo file!** ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
