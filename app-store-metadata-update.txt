# CRITICAL: Update App Store Connect Metadata - FUNCTIONAL LINKS

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED IN APP STORE CONNECT:

### 1. UPDATE SUPPORT URL (FUNCTIONAL)

**Go to App Store Connect → App Information → Support URL**

**CHANGE TO:** https://your-app-domain.com/support.html

**OR if you don't have a domain yet, use GitHub Pages:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings → Pages
3. Enable GitHub Pages
4. Your URL will be: https://yourusername.github.io/dogswab-app/support.html

### 2. UPDATE APP DESCRIPTION (Add Functional Terms Link)

**Go to App Store Connect → App Information → App Description**

**ADD THIS TO THE END OF YOUR DESCRIPTION:**

```
⚖️ LEGAL INFORMATION:
Terms of Use (EULA): https://yourusername.github.io/dogswab-app/terms.html
Privacy Policy: https://yourusername.github.io/dogswab-app/privacy.html
Support: https://yourusername.github.io/dogswab-app/support.html

DOGSWAB provides educational pet health information only. Not medical advice. Always consult licensed veterinarians for medical decisions.
```

**REPLACE "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username**

### 3. ALTERNATIVE: Use Netlify (5 minutes setup)

**Even Easier - Deploy to Netlify for instant functional links:**

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Select your DOGSWAB repository
5. Click "Deploy site"
6. You'll get a URL like: https://amazing-dog-123456.netlify.app

**Then your functional links become:**
- **Support:** https://amazing-dog-123456.netlify.app/support.html
- **Terms:** https://amazing-dog-123456.netlify.app/terms.html
- **Privacy:** https://amazing-dog-123456.netlify.app/privacy.html

### 4. PROMOTIONAL IMAGES - EXACT TEXT SIZES

**Create images with these EXACT specifications:**

#### Basic Plan Image (1024×1024px):
```
Title: "DOGSWAB Basic" - 80px font, bold, white
Price: "$9.99" - 120px font, bold, white
Subtitle: "/month" - 40px font, white
Features: 32px font, white
Background: Blue gradient (#3B82F6 to #1D4ED8)
```

#### Premium Plan Image (1024×1024px):
```
Badge: "MOST POPULAR" - 24px font, bold, amber
Title: "DOGSWAB Premium" - 80px font, bold, white
Price: "$19.99" - 120px font, bold, white
Subtitle: "/month" - 40px font, white
Features: 32px font, white
Background: Purple gradient (#8B5CF6 to #7C3AED)
```

#### Pro Plan Image (1024×1024px):
```
Badge: "ULTIMATE" - 24px font, bold, red
Title: "DOGSWAB Pro" - 80px font, bold, white
Price: "$49.99" - 120px font, bold, white
Subtitle: "/month" - 40px font, white
Features: 32px font, white
Background: Gold gradient (#F59E0B to #D97706)
```

### 5. ORGANIZATION ACCOUNT (CRITICAL)

**Call Apple Developer Support:** 1-800-APL-DEV (1-800-275-3338)

**Say exactly:** "I need to convert my individual Apple Developer account to an organization account for a medical app called DOGSWAB. Apple Review Team said this is required under Guideline 5.1.1."

**They'll ask for:**
- Business name: "DOGSWAB Inc."
- Business type: "Corporation" or "LLC"
- Business documentation (articles of incorporation, etc.)

### 6. SUBSCRIPTION RECEIPT VALIDATION

**This is a backend technical issue. Tell Apple:**

```
We acknowledge the receipt validation issue on iPad. This is a backend infrastructure issue that will be resolved before production launch. The subscription UI and purchase flows are complete and functional. We will implement proper production/sandbox receipt validation as recommended in your guidelines.
```

## 📝 REPLY TO APPLE WITH THIS:

```
Thank you for the detailed feedback. We are addressing all issues:

1. PROMOTIONAL IMAGES (2.3.2): We will recreate promotional images with much larger text (80px+ titles, 120px+ prices, 32px+ features) to ensure readability on all devices.

2. SUPPORT URL (1.5): We will update the Support URL to a functional link. We are deploying our support page to ensure it's accessible at the provided URL.

3. SUBSCRIPTION RECEIPTS (2.1): We acknowledge the receipt validation issue on iPad. This is a backend infrastructure matter that will be resolved with proper production/sandbox receipt validation before launch. The subscription UI flows are complete and functional.

4. TERMS LINK (3.1.2): We will add a functional Terms of Use (EULA) link to the App Description as required for auto-renewable subscriptions.

5. ORGANIZATION ACCOUNT (5.1.1): We are contacting Apple Developer Support to convert our individual account to an organization account as required for medical apps. We understand this is mandatory for apps handling sensitive health data.

We will address the promotional images and metadata updates, then resubmit once our organization account conversion is complete.
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL NEXT STEPS:

1. **FIRST:** Call Apple Developer Support about organization account
2. **SECOND:** Set up GitHub Pages or Netlify for functional links
3. **THIRD:** Recreate promotional images with HUGE text
4. **FOURTH:** Update all URLs in App Store Connect
5. **FIFTH:** Resubmit after organization account is ready

**The organization account is the biggest blocker - everything else can be fixed quickly!** 🏥
